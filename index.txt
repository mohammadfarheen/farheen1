Iam a student at Northwest Mussouri State University pursuing my masters in Applied Computer Science.I would be graduating probably by May 2020

Iam from Guntur ,India. After my graduation in India, I worked as a Software Engineer in Cognizant Technology Solutions.I have experience of 2.6 years on AEM Tool which is a content Management tool that is used to design web pages 

In addition to the tool knowledge ,exposure to some technical knowledge is also equally necessary .So i believe that technical stuff would be added advantage for me..So I moved to US to pursue my masters and I also opted for ComputerScience for this reason

Well,Regarding my carrer plans,I would probably graduate by May 2020.Later I would like to continue working on the same tool in a way better than earlier with better experience to handle and  manage any kind of scenarios and situations.Coming to my hobbies,I love cooking and playing indoor games like carroms,chess in the leisure time.I am a active participant in solving problem related to coding in rank
